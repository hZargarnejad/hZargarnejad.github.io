    <b>Education and Work Background</b>

  <p>
    <pre>
      I am Hanif Zargarnezhad, a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University with a strong focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), turbulence modeling, and multiphase flow analysis. I have extensive experience in simulating fluid dynamics and multiphase phenomena using advanced computational tools such as OpenFOAM, DEALII, and custom codes developed for extreme conditions.

      My research primarily revolves around the development and application of simulation methods to better understand complex fluid flow behaviors, including multiphase flows, heat transfer, and turbulence. Through my work, I have gained proficiency in using a variety of programming languages like Fortran, C++, and Python, as well as applying my knowledge in CFD to real-world engineering problems.

      In addition to my research, I am a Graduate Research Assistant at Texas A&M University, where I contribute to cutting-edge research in fluid-structure interactions and multiphase flow modeling. I also have experience teaching thermodynamics and fluid mechanics labs, further strengthening my ability to communicate complex ideas.

      I am passionate about collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, and I am eager to bring my skills and knowledge to the Computational and Theoretical Multiphysics Lab at Florida State University. I am confident that my expertise in CFD, multiphase simulations, and programming will contribute to the lab's ongoing research efforts.

      Sincerely,
      Hanif Zargarnezhad
