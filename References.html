    <pre>
      My name is Hanif Zargarnezhad. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University, specializing in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), turbulence modeling, and multiphase flows. I have a diverse background in CFD simulations, utilizing software such as OpenFOAM, DEALII, and other computational tools. My research involves the development of simulation software for extreme conditions and the analysis of multiphase flows.

      Currently, I am a Graduate Research Assistant at Texas A&M University, actively contributing to innovative research endeavors. My expertise extends to programming languages, including Fortran, C++, and Python. I have practical experience in teaching advanced thermodynamics and fluid mechanics labs.

      In addition to my academic pursuits, I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with research teams. My master's degree focused on multiphase flows, particularly studying the effects of lattice Boltzmann models in pore-scale simulations in porous media. I am confident that my technical capabilities, programming skills, and strong background in fluid-structure interaction align well with the dynamic and collaborative environment at your lab.

      I am eager to contribute to the Computational and Theoretical Multiphysics Lab at Florida State University and look forward to discussing in more detail how my skills and experiences align with the lab's goals. Thank you for considering my application.

      Sincerely,
      Hanif Zargarnezhad
